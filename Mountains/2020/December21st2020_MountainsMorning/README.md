# Mountain pictures December 21st 2020

Today was the first day of the Winter Solstice, and the clouds looked really good outside. I went and got some pictures today (the 5 listed pictures)

The hardest part of getting these pictures today was doing it blind. I couldn't see what I was doing, as the sun was directly in my eyes, so these 5 pictures were taken with blind photography. Somehow, they still turned out really good.

It is really unusal for it to be so warm and clear on the first official day of Winter. It is about 18.9 degrees Celsius (~66 degrees Fahrenheit) outside in the morning. I didn't even get cold with no shirt outside. Global warming is clearly visible.
